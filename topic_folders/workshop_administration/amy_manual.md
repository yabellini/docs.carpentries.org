## AMY: The Carpentries' internal database

AMY is a database application for The Carpentries.  It allows The Carpentries to track programmatic activity including:

* workshops
* instructor training
* individual roles and badges
* institutional membership

Most functionality is limited to authorized administrative users.  Individuals whose data is tracked in AMY can view only their own profile page. [Read how to access and update your profile](/topic_folders/for_instructors/current_instructors.html#accessing-and-updating-your-instructor-profile).

The code base can be found in the [AMY GitHub repo](https://github.com/carpentries/amy).
