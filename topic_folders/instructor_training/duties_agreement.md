### Instructor Trainers


Instructor Trainers (‘Trainers’) are certified to teach at all authorized Carpentries Instructor Training workshops, onboarding new Instructors who may in turn 
become certified to teach Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, and Software Carpentry workshops. Trainers also play a role in the Instructor ‘checkout’ process, 
evaluating trainees’ teaching demonstrations. The Trainer community plays a leading role in The Carpentries, maintaining our flagship Instructor Training 
Curriculum, contributing to relevant policies, and bringing instructional practices to bear in leadership roles across our local and global communities.

Trainers benefit from being part of a global community of pedagogically trained professionals with a shared interest in promoting robust teaching practices and 
propagating data skills worldwide. Trainers continually build on their own pedagogical and communication skills through co-instruction and monthly community 
discussions about Instructor training. Trainers have opportunities to influence what we teach, through curriculum maintenance, and to steer the progress of this 
community, through leadership roles. Trainers often play leadership roles in their home communities, mentoring local Instructors, and modeling best practices.
