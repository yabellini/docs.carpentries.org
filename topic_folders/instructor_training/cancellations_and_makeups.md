## Attendance Policy


### No Shows

A ‘No Show’ is when a trainee does not cancel prior to an event and does not show up to training. In the event of a No Show, we mark the training seat used.

If extenuating circumstances have prevented a trainee from cancelling or attending an event, they may request permission to register for an additional event using the same registration code by emailing instructor.training@carpentries.org. IMPORTANT: **Requests to re-register <span style="text-decoration:underline;">must</span> be received within 7 days after the end date of the event. **

Trainees with multiple unexplained no-shows may be barred from future registration.


### Partial Absences

Trainees who miss more than 1 hour of an Instructor Training event may be marked absent. Trainees are not eligible for Instructor certification until their record indicates that they have completed a full Instructor Training event.


#### Makeup Meetings

Trainees who miss up to 4 hours (1 half day) of an event can schedule a 50-minute 1:1 makeup meeting to complete their training with The Carpentries Director of Instructor Training. [Makeup meetings can be scheduled via Calendly.](https://calendly.com/karenword/ttt-makeups) Trainees who missed more than 4 hours of an event should not schedule a makeup meeting. (See Retaking a Training Event, below.)

To prepare for a makeup meeting, trainees should review all sections of the Instructor Training Curriculum that they missed and come prepared to share thoughts and questions about those sections.


#### Re-taking a Training Event 

Trainees who miss more than 4 hours (1 half day) of an event are not eligible for a makeup meeting, but can ask to attend another event in full. To request permission to register for an additional training event, trainees should email [instructor.training@carpentries.org](mailto:instructor.training@carpentries.org) within 30 days of a missed event. 

Trainees who miss more than 1 hour of a training may be marked absent, even when they have attended part of a prior event. Multiple partial trainings may not be used to complete the training requirement. 


#### Ineligibility for Makeup Opportunities

Trainees who miss an event in full without cancelling within 7 days (no-show) or who miss part of an event but do not request a makeup opportunity within 30 days are ineligible to register for a new training event using the same registration code. Trainees with a strong interest in completing training may contact [instructor.training@carpentries.org](mailto:instructor.training@carpentries.org) to be advised on their options for re-admission.


## Checkout Extensions Policy

Trainees are asked to complete checkout within 90 days of attending an Instructor Training event. Having a deadline is necessary to support busy people in prioritising a goal we all care about. However, it is sometimes necessary for trainees to postpone completing checkout. 

Trainees who are unable to complete checkout within the 90-day deadline should contact us at [instructor.training@carpentries.org](mailto:instructor.training@carpentries.org) to request an extension.Extensions may be granted up to one year after the checkout deadline.  After one year, you may contact instructor.training@carpentries.org to explore opportunities to re-take the training.
