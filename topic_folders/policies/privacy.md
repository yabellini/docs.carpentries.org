This includes log data, such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”)
address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our sites that you visit,
the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages and other
statistics, and whether you reached our page via a social media or email
campaign. This information may be collected via several technologies, including
cookies and other means.

You can control cookies in your browser to enable or disable them. Learn more in
our [Cookie Policy](cookie-policy.md).

**Information We Collect From Third Parties.** If you access our Sites through
third-parties (e.g., GitHub or Google), or if you share content from our Sites
to a third-party social media service, the third party service may send us
certain information about you if the third party service and your account
settings allow such sharing. The information we receive will depend on the
policies and your account settings with the third party service.

## 2. How Do We Use Personal Information?

**We Never Sell Personal Information.** We will never sell, rent or otherwise
provide your Personal Information to any third party for marketing purposes.

We use your personal information as follows:

* To provide you with the services on our platform, which involves the creation
  and coordination of training events, coding and data science workshops,
  discussions, and other events
* To process donations or workshop administration fees for our programs
* To assess your qualifications as an applicant for one of our community
  volunteer position (such as being an Instructor or a Maintainer) or other Core
  Team member position
* To market our products and/or services to you
* To analyze Sites usage and improve the services offered
* For market research, project planning, troubleshooting problems
* For detecting and protecting against error, fraud or other criminal activity

## 3. How Do We Share Personal Information?

**To the Public with Your Consent.** We may share your name, education, social
media account handles, and professional affiliation with the public with your
consent for your role in our community and other Core Team members’ biographies.
The information you choose to provide to us will determine how much information
is shared with the public. You can opt-in or opt-out of sharing your information
publicly in your AMY profile. With your consent, that you can revoke at any
time, we may also share testimonials, reviews, alongside your personal
information.

**Affiliates and Service Providers.** We share your information with our
third-party service providers and any subcontractors as required to offer you
our products and services. For example, we use MailChimp to send our email
marketing campaigns, HelpScout for communications, Square to process payments,
and ConnectionPoint Systems and GitHub to collect program donations.

**Third Party Links and Websites.** Our Sites may contain links to and from the
websites of third parties. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please
note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not
accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these
policies before you submit any data to these websites.

**Disclosures Required by Law.** We may be required to disclose your data in
response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet law
enforcement requirements. We may be under a duty to disclose or share your
personal information in order to comply with any legal obligation, to enforce or
apply our terms and conditions and other agreements, to protect our rights,
property, or safety, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of others.
This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for
the purposes of fraud protection.

**Aggregate and De-Identified Information.** We reserve the right to share
aggregate or de-identified information about you with our volunteers, workshop
partners, and funding partners in order to analyze and improve our programs,
market our membership program, and apply for funding.

## 4. How Do We Respond to ‘Do Not Track’ Signals?

Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web
browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do
not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and
across websites or online services. When and where possible, we respect DNT
(e.g., page views on our Sites will not be recorded). However, we cannot
guarantee your DNT preference will be recognized across our Sites, as the
Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT
means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to
DNT.

## 5. Cookies

To make our Sites and services work properly, we sometimes place small data
files called cookies on your device. A cookie is a small text file that a
website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It
enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, or
other preferences) over a period of time, so you do not have to keep re-entering
them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another. To
learn more, please see our [Cookie Policy](cookie-policy.md).

## 6. Your Privacy Choices

Please contact us if you would like to request access and/or make any changes to
your personal information.

**Marketing Opt-Out:** We may use your personal information to contact you with
newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may
be of interest to you. You may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these
communications from us by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in any
email we send, or you can contact us using the contact details provided in the
“[Contact Information](#contact-information)” section below.

  of our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md), maintaining the security of our

  requests by public authorities, including to meet law enforcement

You may contact us using the contact details provided in the “[Contact
Information](#contact-information)” section below for more information or to
exercise your rights.

## 9. International Transfers of Data

Given the international nature of our organization, to be able to process your
personal data, it is necessary for us to transfer or share your personal data
outside the UK/EEA:

- with Core Team members within our organization who are located outside the
    UK/EEA;
- with your and our service providers, (e.g., cloud service providers), who
  might have servers located outside the UK/EEA;
- if you are based outside the UK/EEA;
- where there is a European and/or international dimension to the services we
    are providing to you.

We will only transfer or share your personal data outside the UK/EEA:

- to a country, territory or organization that has been assessed as providing an
  adequate level of protection for personal data ‘adequacy decision’ by the UK
  or the EU Commission;
- By using legally-approved UK or EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCS) or
  Model Clauses, in addition to implementing appropriate supplementary measures
  to ensure the protection of the personal data.

If you are located in the UK or the EU, you may contact us at
[privacy@carpentries.org](mailto:privacy@carpentries.org) to request a copy of
the Standard Contractual Clauses.

By accessing our Sites and using our Services, you acknowledge that your
personal data may be collected and transferred from your local jurisdiction
(including those in the European Economic Area and the UK) to the United
States or other jurisdictions.

## 10. Children’s Privacy

The Sites are not directed at individuals under the age of 16. We do not
knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If you become
aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us
using the contact details provided in the “[Contact Information](#contact-information)” section below.
If we become aware that a child under 16 has provided us with personal
information, we will take steps to delete such information.

## 11. Change of Control

Personal information may be transferred to a third party as a result of a
merger, reorganization or other change in control.

## 12. How Do We Protect Personal Information?
    
We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your
personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal
information. For example, when possible, we use encryption to transfer and store
data. We further limit access to this data using access controls and
confidentiality commitments.

However, no website, application, or transmission can guarantee security. Thus,
while we have established and maintain what we believe to be reasonable
procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal
information obtained through the Sites, we cannot ensure or warrant the security
of any information you transmit to us.

## 13. Policy Changes

We may change our Privacy Policy at any time. We encourage you to periodically
review this Privacy Policy to ensure you are familiar with the most current
version.
