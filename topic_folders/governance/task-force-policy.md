## The Carpentries Task Force Policy

See the definition of a [task force](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html#task-forces)
according to the Bylaws.

This policy defines the process for making and approving task force proposals, and
operational processes and the lines of communication to and from task forces
to ensure transparency, accountability and sustainability of task forces' activities.

#### Task Force Proposal
A task force proposal should:
- explain the need for or the context of the task force
- list aims and objectives of the task force
- set a timeline for the start and completion of the task force's activities/deliverables.

Task force proposals can be submitted by [creating an
issue](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/issues) in the 
[*task forces* repository](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces) in [The Carpentries GitHub](https://github.com/carpentries/) or
by emailing the proposal to the [Core Team](mailto:team@carpentries.org).

### Task Force Formation
Task force proposals are reviewed and approved according to the following procedure:

- Task force proposals by the Executive Council are approved implicitly
- Task force proposals by the Core Team do not require a formal approval of the Executive Council and the Executive Council should only be informed
- Task force proposals by community members need to be submitted to the Core Team.
  If the Core Team endorses and approves the proposal, the Executive Council is informed of this decision. If the Core
  Team feels that the proposal requires the Executive Council's review,
  the Executive Director can bring the proposal to the Executive Council's attention.

Upon approval, the task force is listed at [The Carpentries website](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces)
with a link to its public documentation.

### Task Force Operations
The following are operational guidelines for task forces. Each task force should:

- Create the official [task force charter](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/blob/master/task-force-charter-template.md), 
including the task force's roles and responsibilities
- Appoint the task force chair, and, optionally, a co-chair
- Request a [Core Team](https://carpentries.org/team/) member liaison to serve as a point of contact and (optionally) attend the task force meetings
- Create a public space for the task force, including:
  - The task force's charter and its current status (e.g. active, completed)
  - Contact information for the task force
  - Other public materials (if available)
  - Information on when the task force meetings are held
  - Meeting notes (if appropriate)
  - Name of the Core Team liaison person
  - Information on how to apply to join the task force
  - The task force report to the Executive Council (once produced, after the work of the task forces is completed)
- Create internal [documentation for operational procedures](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/blob/main/task-force-charter-template.md#task-force-charter-name-of-task-force) (which may also be made public), including:
  - Process for recruiting and/or selecting new members
  - Decision making process
- Maintain internal and public-facing communication:
  - Organise regular meetings to progress with the task force's activities and post meeting notes in a consistent location (meeting notes should be public unless the work of the task force requires them to remain private)
  - Post meetings in the community calendar (note that meetings do not necessarily need to be open to public to attend even though they are added to the calendar)
  - Utilise other [Carpentries community communication pathways](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/index.html) to engage with the community as needed

The task force's public documentation should be stored in a folder within the [`task-forces` repository](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces) 
in [The Carpentries GitHub](https://github.com/carpentries/).
The Core Team will assist with creating such a folder upon the task force's approval. If the task force has sensitive 
internal documentation, the task force should decide where such documentation should be stored. 

A task force will not undertake any of the following actions without obtaining approval of the Executive Council:

- Any modifications to the Code of Conduct
- Creation and/or release of position statements
- Host Carpentries-branded events
- Any modifications of The Carpentries logos (please refer to the [Carpentries Logo Usage Policy](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/resources/logos.html) for the approved ways of using the logos)
- Launch an own fundraising campaign.

Note that the above list is not exhaustive. In the case of any ambiguity, task forces should consult the Core Team (in the first instance) or the
Executive Council to clarify if anything they plan to do requires approval.

### Task Force Termination
A task force will naturally cease to function upon fulfilling its role.
The Core Team may terminate task forces that it had approved.
Executive Council may terminate any task force at any time.

### Past & Current Task Forces
